# Shutting Down My Daily Quiz Project â€“ Hereâ€™s What I Learned

Hey everyone,

A few weeks ago, I launched a daily quiz platform as a quick experiment â€“ built it in a weekend, launched it, and got some solid engagement. But now, Iâ€™ve decided to shut it down.

## Why?
- It was a fun idea, but not something I want to keep maintaining.
- Engagement was decent, but not enough to justify further work.
- Learned a lot about launching quickly and user behaviour!

This was a great experience, and I might revisit something similar in the future, but for now, Iâ€™m moving on to other projects.

If youâ€™re curious about the process, happy to answer any questions! ðŸš€

Thanks to everyone who checked it out! ðŸŽ‰
